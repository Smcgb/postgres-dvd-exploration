## Postgres DVD Exploration - SQL

### Description

This project was used to fine tune my skills with window functions, ctes and reinforce basic sql styling.
Using the Sakila dvd rental database found at 
https://postgrestutorial.com/postgres-getting-started/postgres-sample-database/

### Questions answered

1. Which actors have the the most rental time (sum rental duration)?
2. What is the most popular film per customer?
3. What is the most popular category of rental for the top 10 customers by revenue?
4. How does performance in sales compare across staff members

### Visualization

Basic visualizations are offered in the PowerBI file attached. the CSVs within this direcotry will need to be attached and 
likely have headers manually input in order for the visualizations to load. A preview of the visualizations can be found in the
attached PowerPoint presentation as well.
